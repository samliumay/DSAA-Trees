# DSAA-Trees
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Explanation of Trees methods. 
* Basic Explanation of Trees Methods complexity. 

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* Explaining the Trees deeply. 
* Explanation of Trees methods compelxity and how to calculate them. 
* Turkish and English versions are avaiable.
